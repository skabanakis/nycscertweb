    <h1><strong>About me</strong> </h1>
    Hi, My name is Stephannia Kabanakis!

I am a current teacher at Mineola High School. 

I teach AP CSP, Exploring Computer Science, and Accounting.

This summer I have enrolled in the following classes to help build my foundation on computer science:
    <br><h1>  - Programming in Java </h1>
    <h4>Background:</h4> This class was challenging. Learning a new language on rapid fire was intresting. Luckily the pre-work helped in breaking down the concepts, however the porgrams we needed to create was a greater challenge because it was many games / concepts I was not familiar with. With the help of my amazing classmates/teachers, we were able to complete the following programs:
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li>Nim</li>
    <li>Mancala</li>
    <li>TwoDimArray</li>
    <li>Fib</li>
    <li>SuperArray</li>
    
</ol>
    <br> <h1> - Data Structrues </h1>
    <h4>Background:</h4>
    In this course we are learning about different data structures that include:
       <ul>
       <li>Linked List</li>
       <li>Knights Tour</li>
        <li>Maze Code</li>
         <li>Sorted</li>
          <li>Binary Trees</li>
           <li>Queue</li> 
           <li>Double Link List</li>
           
           
       </ul>
     <br><h1> - Methods I </h1>
     <h4>Background:</h4> In this course we learned different types if methods and way to implement them into our classrooms. We learned about different sources that are avaialble to us and how to trouble shoot them. In addition to effective ways to implement them.
