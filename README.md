<h1>About me </h1>
Hi, My name is Stephannia Kabanakis!

I am a current teacher at Mineola High School. 

I teach AP CSP, Exploring Computer Science, and Accounting.

This summer I have enrolled in the following classes to help build my foundation on computer science:
    <br><h1>  - Programming in Java </h1>
    <h4>Background:</h4> This class was challenging. Learning a new language on rapid fire was intresting. Luckily the pre-work helped in breaking down the concepts, however the porgrams we needed to create was a greater challenge because it was many games / concepts I was not familiar with. With the help of my amazing classmates/teachers, we were able to complete the following programs:
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li>Nim</li>
    </ol>
    <br> <h1> - Data Structrues </h1>
     <br><h1> - Methods I </h1>
