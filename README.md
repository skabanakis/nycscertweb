    <h1>About me </h1>
    Hi, My name is Stephannia Kabanakis!

I am a current teacher at Mineola High School. 

I teach AP CSP, Exploring Computer Science, and Accounting.

This summer I have enrolled in the following classes to help build my foundation on computer science:
    <br><h1>  - Programming in Java </h1>
    <h4>Background:</h4> This class was challenging. Learning a new language on rapid fire was intresting. Luckily the pre-work helped in breaking down the concepts, however the porgrams we needed to create was a greater challenge because it was many games / concepts I was not familiar with. With the help of my amazing classmates/teachers, we were able to complete the following programs:
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li>Nim</li>
    <li>Mancala</li>
    <li>TwoDimArray</li>
    <li>Fib</li>
    <li>SuperArray</li>
    <li>Nim</li>
</ol>
    <br> <h1> - Data Structrues </h1>
    <h4>Background:</h4>
    In this course we are learning about different data structures that include:
       <ul>
       <li>Linked List</li>
       <li>Knights Tour</li>
        <li>Maze Code</li>
         <li>Sorted</li>
          <li>Trees</li>'    
       </ul>
     <br><h1> - Methods I </h1>
     <h4>Background:</h4>
